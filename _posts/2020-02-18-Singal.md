## Paper List - Traffic Signal Control

This is a list of papers about traffic signal control in reinforcement learning, especially for some special traffic situation (including some traffic flow control papers). It is collected together by my friend and colleague [Zhenyuan Ma](https://zhenyuanma.github.io/)
