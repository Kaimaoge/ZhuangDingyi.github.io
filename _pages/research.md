**A General Framework Based on Temporally Dynamic Adjacency Matrix for Long-Term Traffic Prediction**
*McGill University, Dec. 2019 ~ Feb. 2020*
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/)
*Co-worker*: Fuqiang Liu, Jiawei Wang, [Jingbo Tian](https://joshuatian-mcgill.github.io/) and [Prof. Luis Miranda-Moreno](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/luis-miranda-moreno) 
* Introduced a general framework with Bias Block to improve the performance of seq2seq extreme long-time prediction.
* Used STGCN, DCRNN and GWNet as base model and chose Matrix Factorization, VAR and SVR as the baseline to prove that our model obtain higher accuracy and stronger interpretability. 
* Geodata visualization with Python and paper writing (In proceeding of KDD'2020).

[**Bayesian Poisson Tensor Factorization for Learning Paratransit Mobility Patterns**](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/project_cive_648.pdf) 
*McGill University, Oct. 2019 ~ Dec. 2019*
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/)
* Derived and implemented Bayesian Poisson Tensor Factorization to learn latent patterns of paratransit service for the disabled people in the region-level.
* Discovered multiple peak-time, indifference between weekdays&weekends as temporal patterns and discuss the spatial regularity.
* Offered a trial on a marginal research field and appealed for more researches of the disabled and how their transit can be improved.

**A Spatial-temporal Deep Learning Framework for Network-wide Bus Passenger Flow Prediction**
*National University of Singapore, Apr. 2019~ Aug. 2019* 
*National University of Singapore, Apr. 2019~ Aug. 2019*
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/) and [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)
*Co-worker*: Dr. Siyu Hao
* Proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework (spatial-temporal block) that aims at making multi-step collective prediction for different types of bus passenger flow (boarding and alighting) in a network-wide region level.
* Captured simultaneously both long-range spatial dependencies and the correlations with channel dimension and predicted the boarding demand and alighting demand at each region in the near future.

**A Pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Network based Framework for Short-term Mixed Passenger Flow Prediction in Large-scale Public Transit**
*National University of Singapore, Apr. 2019~ Aug. 2019*
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/) and [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)
*Co-worker*: Dr. Siyu Hao and De Zhao
*  Proposed a Pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Network (Pseudo-3DCNN) based model to predict the public transport passenger flow in a network-wide region level.
*  Took metro passenger flow, bus passenger flow as well as the transfer flow between metro system and bus system together into consideration instead of merely predicting a single type of passenger flow.
*  The feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model has been demonstrated on real-world data collected in Singapore.
*  Paper presented in TRB 2020.

[**Understanding semantic similarity among subway stations using smart card data**](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/Final_report_prof_lee.pdf) 
*National University of Singapore, July. 2018~ Sept. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/) and [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)
*Co-worker*: Dr. Siyu Hao
  * Proposed a new conception to understand metropolitan mobility as words  
  * Independently selected mobility features then trained stacked autoencoder network to discover mobility semantics  
  * Applied topic modeling (TF-IDF+SVD+LDA) on scraped POI data to find service semantics 
  * Geodata visualization with Python

[**Understanding the bike sharing travel demand and cycle lane network: the case of Shanghai**](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/2018-08-23-Pre-Bikesharing.pdf)  [doi](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2019.1699209) 
*Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Mar. 2017~ June. 2018*  
*Advisor*: [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)  
  * Proposed methods to scrape data from bike-sharing application  
  * Applied graphic clustering to mine the insight of bike-sharing data  
  * Suggested a method to explore cycle lane network then presented advice for urban planning  
  * Paper accepted by *6th T-LOG*, *TSTE 2018* and published in *International Journal of Sustainable Transportation*.
