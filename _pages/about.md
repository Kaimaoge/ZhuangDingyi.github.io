I am a M.Eng (thesis) student in Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics of [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My instructor in McGill is [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and was a research student of [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). My supervisors in two universities are [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2) and  [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/) respectively. Click [here](http://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/zhuang_dingyi_cv_extended.pdf) to view my up-to-date CV. If you want to know more about me, please feel free to [contact me (dingyi.zhuang at mail dot mcgill dot ca)](mailto:dingyi.zhuang@mail.mcgill.ca).

My research interests lie in spatial-temporal data mining and urban computing, particularly in applying advanced graph network methods on intelligent transportation system and human mobility modeling to solve urban transportation issues and build a smart city.
